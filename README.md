# ðŸŽ§ LASSO Audio Denoising

This project applies **LASSO regression** to remove noise from audio signals by exploiting **sparse frequency representations**. The technique solves a linear inverse problem using L1 regularization.

## ðŸ”Š Problem

We are given a noisy piano signal `y = Ax + e`, where `A` is a transformation matrix (e.g., inverse DCT), and `x` is a sparse frequency-domain signal. The goal is to recover `x` and reconstruct the clean sound.
